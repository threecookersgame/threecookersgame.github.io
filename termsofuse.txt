4. Purchases In The Services

•    In-app Purchases.
When you make in-app purchases ("Virtual Items"), the payment for such purchases  may be processed either by third parties on our behalf, or directly by the owner of the Online Store. If you download the Apps from the Online Store owner, when you        purchase Virtual Items in our game, threecookersgameis not a party to the            transaction and your purchase will be governed by the third-party platform’s payment terms and conditions. Please review the platform’s terms of service for additional       information. Thus, if you have any payment related issues (including cancellation or  refund requests), then you will need to contact the respective Online Store owner       directly.
You understand that while you may “earn,” “buy,” or “purchase” Virtual Items in our Services, you do not legally “own” the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual  Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Any “virtual currency” balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your   limited license.
Please note that you only purchase a limited, revocable, non-transferrable license for  personal use of Virtual Items in the Services. Virtual Items are not “sold” to you. You agree that you do not own any Virtual Items that you obtained through the Services,   regardless of whether you earned those Virtual Items or purchased them.
When making purchases in the Services, you agree that the digital content will be        available to you immediately, and acknowledge that you will lose your rights to the 14 days cancellation period and refunds available for EU and EEA residents.

Some of threecookersgame’s Games may offer subscription-based Services. If    you purchase a subscription, then by clicking the purchase button you are requesting that we begin supplying the subscription Services immediately and you are entering  into a recurring subscription contract with threecookersgame. You are also          authorizing a charge to you on a recurring subscription fee at the rate quoted at the    time of purchase. By purchasing a subscription, we will automatically charge on a     recurring basis the payment method associated with your account. For subscription    Services purchased in a threecookersgameGame played on a platform such as      Apple or Google, the applicable platform will charge you for the subscription fee and the platform’s payment terms will apply. Please review the appropriate platform’s     payment terms for additional information.
Trial subscriptions are offered free of charge for a certain period of time from              activation specified in the relevant trial offer in the Game. If you do not cancel the       subscription within such trial period, the trial subscription will automatically convert   into a paid subscription for the fees and for the subscription period set out in the Game at the time of the activation of the trial period. You may cancel a subscription during   its free trial period using the subscription setting of your account.
Your subscription will automatically renew each subscription period unless and until  you terminate your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews, otherwise payment of the subscription fees for the next period will    be taken automatically via your chosen payment method. In case the subscription fee  cannot be taken from your account due to absence of monetary funds, invalidity of     credit card or for any other reason, your subscription will be automatically cancelled.
Except where required by applicable law, paid subscription fees are non-refundable.
